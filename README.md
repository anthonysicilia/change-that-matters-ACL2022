# change-that-matters-ACL2022

This is the code repository for [The Change that Matters in Discourse Parsing: Estimating the Impact of Domain Shift on Parser Error](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11317) to appear in Findings of ACL 2022. 

This research was conducted in conjunction with “PAC-Bayesian Domain Adaptation Bounds for Multiclass Learners” to appear in UAI 2022.

## Code
Code for summarizing raw results (e.g., producing regression plots) is available in this repository. Code for producing the raw results used in this paper is available in the shared code repository [here](https://github.com/anthonysicilia/multiclass-domain-divergence). Further, a python package designed to assist in estimating the impact of domain shift on parser error is available [here](https://github.com/anthonysicilia/classifier-divergence).

Please consider citing one or both papers if you use this code.
